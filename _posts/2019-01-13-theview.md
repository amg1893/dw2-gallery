First time in 'The View'. This was really impressive, as going to this point you have to pass a neutron star. The cones were magnificent.

The beacon used for 'The View' was also really beautiful, and joined with the rings and both stars were perfect together.

After a few minutes, CMDR Rico S. arrived. First foreigner that I encounter! My fellow CMDR [Deno Nisshoku](https://twitter.com/CmdrDeno) also joined me to see this beautiful landscape. The three ships, two Asp Explorer and one Krait Phantom. Pretty drastic colors.

A Beluga entered also 'The View' and joined us in this precious moment. Also, more ships were coming and going but no one stoped by to say hi to us.

We were trully sad about that.
