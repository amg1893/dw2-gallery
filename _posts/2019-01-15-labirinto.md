Labirinto was the 4th POI of the first week of DW2. The "canyon planet" is so pretty that I went between the fissures.

Also, I found a place to land and deploy the SRV. I didn't go too far as it's pretty difficult to drive there.

I really really liked this POI. One of the best spots so far, you can also see Lagoon Nebula from here.
